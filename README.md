# XCode-Apps
Hello. 
My team and I are currently working on a project to develop a comprehensive water quality monitoring system for the Navesink River and Sandy Hook Bay. Given your extensive experience in coastal resilience and water quality research, we believe your mentorship would greatly enhance the success and impact of our project. 
Our aim is to design and implement a network of cost-effective data-collecting buoys capable of monitoring key water parameters, such as temperature, pH, turbidity, and TDS using IOT technology. Additionally, we plan to create an accompanying app to analyze and display the collected data, providing the public with real-time information on water quality for informed decision-making regarding actions to protect the environment while fostering environmental awareness. 
This code is being used to build an xcode app for my Systems II Senior Project
